      which produces computer software, consumer electronics, personal
      computers, and related services. Its best-known software products are the
      Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite,
      and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware

      Microsoft (the word being a portmanteau of "microcomputer software") was
      founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell
      BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal
      computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by
      Microsoft Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and
      subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an
      estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s,
      it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has
      made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the
      acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[6] followed by
      their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.

      As of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible
      operating system market and the office software suite market, although it
      has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android.
      The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise
      software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including
      Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN),
      mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software
      development (Visual Studio).
